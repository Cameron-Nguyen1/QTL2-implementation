# QTL2-implementation
A shallow implementation of Karl Broman's QTL2 R package for Quantative Trait Loci (QTL) analysis.

## The results
- A PDF that shows QTL peaks by tested phenotype.
- A CSV that is comprised of queried Ensembl data within significant QTL peaks.
- A CSV that shows the numbers that form the basis of the QTL peaks graphed on PDF.

## How to use?
- Simply replace the default value for the .yaml control value with the actual file name of your control file
- Change any file names, passed as arguments to custom functions, to personalize the results.

## Use this reference control file to guide the creation of your control file.
